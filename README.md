A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two child nodes, commonly referred to as the left child and right child. Each node in a binary tree contains a value or key and a pointer to its left and right child nodes, or null if the child does not exist.

Binary trees are commonly used in computer science and programming for efficient searching, sorting, and data organization. The structure of a binary tree makes it possible to perform many operations on it, including searching for a particular node, inserting a new node, deleting a node, and traversing the tree to retrieve data in a specific order.

There are several types of binary trees, including:

Full binary tree: A binary tree where every node has either zero or two children.
Complete binary tree: A binary tree where all levels except the last level are completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are left-justified.
Balanced binary tree: A binary tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
Binary trees are often used in algorithms and data structures such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and heap data structures.
